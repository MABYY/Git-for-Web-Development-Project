Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

Block elements always Start a new Line and take up all the with available on the website, while inline elements don not. Block elements forcé a new line of content automatically. When we do not want a new line of text we use inline elements.

Inline elements take the width defined by the content. Block elements take a width equal to 100% by default. The parent element is actually the one that limits their size.   

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
